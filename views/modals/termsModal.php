            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">7.3 Without prejudice to any other rights to which the Supplier may

               Customer’s failure to comply with any obligations under Clause 7.1 shall be deemed to be a
               cancellation of the Services and subject to the payment of damages set out in this Clause 7.3.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">7.4 In the event that the Customer or any third party, not being a
               sub-contractor of the Supplier, shall omit or commit anything which prevents or delays the
               Supplier
               from undertaking or complying with any of its obligations under this Agreement, then the
               Supplier
               shall notify the Customer as soon as possible and:</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">7.4.1 the Supplier shall have no liability in respect of any delay
               to the
               completion of the work;</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">7.4.2 if applicable, the timetable for the work will be modified

               work that
               the Supplier undertakes during the Cleaning Process.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">7.6 Insurance of the Customer’s Vehicle is the Customer’s
               responsibility
               at all times. The Supplier does not undertake to insure such Vehicle against loss or damage
               whilst it
               is at the Premises. The Supplier will however en-sure that the Vehicle is locked at all times.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">7.7 Child seats should be removed by the Customer prior to the
               Vehicle
               being left at the Premises. Any seats left in the Customer’s Vehicle shall remain in such
               Vehicle
               whilst the Supplier undertakes the Cleaning Process. The Supplier shall not be responsible for
               putting
               car seats back into the Vehicle and the Customer must ensure that any child seats are secure
               before

               will immediately result in the Service being terminated and such Vehicle will be secured and the
               relevant authorities notified. It is not the Supplier’s responsibility to notify the Customer of
               this
               should it occur.</p>

               shall not be liable for loss or damage caused to you or your Vehicle as a result of us locking
               them in
               your Vehicle.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">The Supplier reserves the right to refuse to clean a Vehicle and no
               further contracts will be undertaken for the Customer concerned.</p>

               damage
               caused to the Customer’s Vehicle through the use of these products. The Supplier’s staff take
               every
               care when using these products.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">12.2 In certain products there are chemicals used which are
               hazardous,
               therefore we respectfully request that the Customer does not stand next to any Vehicle whilst it
               is
               being washed and utilise our waiting area. Alternatively, we request the Customer remains at a
               minimum
               of 30 feet away from such Vehicle. Any harm or injury caused by products splashing on to the
               Customer
               due to the aforementioned not being adhered to cannot be the responsibility of the Supplier and
               is at
